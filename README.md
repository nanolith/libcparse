libcparse
=========

This is a hand written parser for C that performs both a preprocessor parse and
a regular C token parse. I needed a parser that I could use to optionally expand
the preprocessor tokens, so that I could do ahead-of-time syntax highlighting.
I also intend to use this parser for C tooling.
